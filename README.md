## GAN-based unsupervised classification of snowflake images

This Python/TensorFlow code demonstrates unsupervised snowflake classification from images obtained with the [Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera](http://www.inscc.utah.edu/~tgarrett/Snowflakes/MASC.html) using a GAN and K-medoids classification. It supports a paper "Unsupervised classification of snowflake images using a generative adversarial network and K-medoids classification" to be submitted to Atmospheric Measurement Techniques and provides all code needed to replicate the results. 

## Instructions

### Requirements
You need a Python 3 environment and the following libraries:
- TensorFlow (not tested with 2.0+)
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Python NetCDF4
- h5py
- imageio
- Dask

A GPU is highly recommended for training, but the experiments with pre-trained models can be run on a CPU as well. 16+ GB of RAM should be enough.

### Data

Download the training datasets [here](https://github.com/jleinonen/snow-gan-classification/releases/download/datasets/masc_combined_datasets.zip) (they are too big to include in the repository). 
Save the `.nc` and `.npy` files in the `data` directory.

If you want to use the pre-trained models, you can download them [here](https://github.com/jleinonen/snow-gan-classification/releases/download/models/masc_infogan_combined.zip).
Save the contents of the zip file in the `models` directory.

### Running the code

The high-level code that runs the training and evaluation needed to replicate the results can be found in `replication.py`. This file has a command line interface (see below), but you could also call the functions within from an iPython terminal or a Jupyter notebook. 

If you want to modify the training code, you should start by following the code flow in `replication.training`.

#### Running the plotting and evaluation

You can evaluate the model and generate the plots shown in the paper using the downloadable datasets and the pre-trained GAN on the command line in the `snow-gan-classification` directory like this:
```bash
python replication.py experiments --model_name=../models/masc_infogan_combined
```
where `model_name` is the name of the model you want to load (use the default for the pre-trained model). For the pre-trained model, this should replicate the results exactly. If you trained the GAN yourself, you probably will get slightly different results. The plots will be saved in the `figures` directory.

In practice, you may want to run the experiments one by one by copypasting the code from `replication.experiments` to a terminal.

#### Training the GAN

You can run the training like this:
```bash
python replication.py train --model_save_name=../models/masc_infogan
```
Change the `--model_save_name` parameter to the name of the model you want to save. You can load a pre-existing model at the start of training using the `--model_name` parameter. So, for example, to load the pre-trained model and train it further:
```bash
python replication.py train --model_name=../models/masc_infogan_combined --model_save_name=../models/masc_infogan
```

#### Computing the latent variables

Run the following to compute the latent variables for all snowflakes in the dataset:
```bash
python replication.py latents --model_name=../models/masc_infogan_combined --latents_file=../data/masc_latents.nc --latent_dist_file=../data/masc_latent_dist.nc
```
where the `--latents_file` and `--latent_dist_file` parameters control where the latents are saved.
